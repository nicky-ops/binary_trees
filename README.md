# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a binary tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
A recursive definition using set theory is that a binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root.

#### Types of binary trees
* Rooted binary trees
* Full binary tree
* Perfect binary tree
* A complete binary tree
* A balanced binary tree
* A degenerate tree

* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree

* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
